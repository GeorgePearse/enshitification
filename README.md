# Enshittification

A collection documenting examples of platform decay and enshittification across the tech industry.

## What is Enshittification?

**Enshittification** (also known as *crapification* and *platform decay*) is a pattern where two-sided online products and services decline in quality over time:

1. **Phase 1**: Platforms create high-quality offerings to attract users
2. **Phase 2**: They degrade offerings to better serve business customers (advertisers)
3. **Phase 3**: They degrade services to everyone to maximize short-term shareholder profits

> "Here is how platforms die: first, they are good to their users; then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers; finally, they abuse those business customers to claw back all the value for themselves. Then, they die."
> — Cory Doctorow

The term was coined by Cory Doctorow in November 2022 and was selected as:
- **2023 Word of the Year** by the American Dialect Society
- **2024 Word of the Year** by Australia's Macquarie Dictionary

## Examples

### Social Media

#### Twitter / X
- **API pricing explosion**: Free tier eliminated (Feb 2023), enterprise jumped from $2,899/month to $42,000/month
- "Overnight, thousands of bots went dark, student projects broke, and indie developers scrambled"
- Third-party apps (Tweetbot, Twitterrific, etc.) forced to shut down entirely
- Basic tier doubled from $100 to $200/month (late 2024)
- Closure of API to prevent interoperable software
- Suspending users for posting Mastodon handles
- Rate limits on tweet viewing without logging in
- Paid subscriptions (Twitter Blue / X Premium) to restore reach
- Algorithm modified to promote Musk's posts above others
- New users required to pay to post (April 2024)

- [Twitter APIs Are Going Very Wrong](https://thenewstack.io/twitter-apis-are-going-very-wrong/)

#### Facebook
- Started as platform for connecting with friends
- Morphed into ad-heavy space with exploitative algorithms
- Prioritizes engagement metrics and ad revenue over user experience

### The "Enshittification of Work"

#### Gig Economy Labor Conditions
- 2025 academic study: enshittification framework applies to labor conditions
- Three mechanisms: burden-shifting, feature-addition/alteration, market-manipulation
- Platforms shift from favorable conditions to increased precarity and opacity
- Worker responses: effort-recalibration, multi-homing (joining multiple platforms), "toxic resilience"
- [The Enshittification of Work (Academic Paper)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjir.70004)

#### Tech Industry Employment
- "Employers like Google and Netflix realized how much leverage they could get... so they pampered the shit out of these kids"
- Once cash was flowing, "they could start taking the screws to the employees"
- Meta: 5% layoff announced same day executive bonuses doubled
- Workers doing "two or three jobs, for worse pay, without all those lovely perks"
- [The Enshittification of Tech Jobs](https://medium.com/@doctorow/https-pluralistic-net-2025-04-25-some-animals-are-more-equal-than-others-9acd84d46742)

---

## The Pattern

All these examples follow the same lifecycle:

```
Attract Users (subsidized) → Attract Business Customers → Extract Value → Decay
```

Key mechanisms:
- **Burden-shifting**: Operational costs transferred to workers/users
- **Feature-addition and alteration**: New demands increase user effort
- **Market-manipulation**: Reducing bargaining power, opaque deactivations
- **Lock-in**: High switching costs prevent users from leaving

---

## Solutions (Per Doctorow)

1. **End-to-end principle**: Platforms should transmit data in response to user requests, not algorithm-driven decisions
2. **Right of exit**: Users can leave platforms without losing access to data (requires interoperability)

---

## Impact

- **Cognitive harm**: Platforms overproduce ads, lose original function, causing loss in ability to process information
- **Labor market effects**: Gig platforms steadily degrade work quality for contractors
- **User migration**: Fear of missing out keeps users on decaying platforms, but many migrate between multiple social media
