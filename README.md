# Enshittification

A collection documenting examples of platform decay and enshittification across the tech industry.

## What is Enshittification?

**Enshittification** (also known as *crapification* and *platform decay*) is a pattern where two-sided online products and services decline in quality over time:

1. **Phase 1**: Platforms create high-quality offerings to attract users
2. **Phase 2**: They degrade offerings to better serve business customers (advertisers)
3. **Phase 3**: They degrade services to everyone to maximize short-term shareholder profits

> "Here is how platforms die: first, they are good to their users; then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers; finally, they abuse those business customers to claw back all the value for themselves. Then, they die."
> — Cory Doctorow

The term was coined by Cory Doctorow in November 2022 and was selected as:
- **2023 Word of the Year** by the American Dialect Society
- **2024 Word of the Year** by Australia's Macquarie Dictionary

## Examples

### Social Media

#### Twitter / X
- Closure of API to prevent interoperable software
- Suspending users for posting Mastodon handles
- Rate limits on tweet viewing without logging in
- Paid subscriptions (Twitter Blue / X Premium) to restore reach
- Algorithm modified to promote Musk's posts above others
- New users required to pay to post (April 2024)
- Revenue fell 84% by August 2024 compared to pre-Musk ownership

#### Facebook
- Started as platform for connecting with friends
- Morphed into ad-heavy space with exploitative algorithms
- Prioritizes engagement metrics and ad revenue over user experience
- Reduced organic reach; users now asked to pay for posts to reach followers
- Facebook metrics controversy: inflated video statistics led media companies to over-invest and collapse

#### TikTok
- Rising ads and sponsored content disrupting user experience
- Algorithm actively "punishes" performers by not delivering their videos to subscribers
- Every time TikTok shows you content you asked for, it loses a chance to show you content it wants you to see

- Algorithm changes favor irrelevant, low-quality viral content
- Search results favor those who pay the most over relevance
- Milking business customers with high fees
- 55% increase in premium subscriptions (2024) as job hunters have no alternative
- No real competitor has emerged, enabling continued extraction
- Feed flooded with engagement-bait: emoji polls, chain letters, reaction-farming
- "Professional" platform increasingly resembles Facebook feed quality

### Ride-Sharing & Delivery

#### Uber
- Initially: friendlier drivers, cleaner cars, convenient ride-hailing
- Used VC funding to subsidize fares at a loss until taxi companies couldn't survive
- Once competitors left market: surge pricing, higher fares, reduced driver compensation
- Drivers: shifted from flexibility promises to increased precarity and opacity

#### Lyft
- Similar trajectory to Uber
- Duopoly allows both to increase prices

#### DoorDash / Delivery Apps
- COVID normalized paying higher prices plus delivery fees plus tips for tepid food
- Skim at both ends: fees on customers AND restaurants
- Drives restaurants to become delivery-only
- DoorDash lost $600 million in 2019
- Only had one profitable month in eight years (April 2020)

---

### Accommodation

#### Airbnb

- Once VC funding ran out, cheap prices disappeared
- Many listings now more expensive than hotels
- Fewer amenities, deceptive advertising
- Additional rules and fees by hosts
- Less quality control
- Sometimes hidden cameras

---

### Dating Apps
- Conflict between ostensible goal (matchmaking) and operators' desire (convert to paid, retain as paying users)
- Perverse incentive: keeping users single keeps them paying
- Mathematical modeling shows it's financially beneficial to offer sub-optimal experience

---

### Gaming

- Microsoft raised prices and restricted features
- "Once you start raising prices and restricting common features, you're already on the path toward enshittification"

#### Ubisoft

- Single-player elements disappear because of DRM

---

### Productivity & Creative Software

- Degraded through increased advertising and SEO gaming
- Jedi Blue: rigged ad market to recapture value
- Fired 12,000 employees while doing stock buybacks that "would have paid all their salaries for the next 27 years"

- Controls majority of browser installations

---

### Hardware & Ecosystem Lock-in

#### Apple
- App Store forces developers to pay 15-30% commission
- Bans alternative payment methods
- Threatens app bans for stepping out of line
- For users: higher prices and less choice
- "Walled garden" designed to extract more with every iteration

---

## The Pattern

All these examples follow the same lifecycle:

```
Attract Users (subsidized) → Attract Business Customers → Extract Value → Decay
```

Key mechanisms:
- **Burden-shifting**: Operational costs transferred to workers/users
- **Feature-addition and alteration**: New demands increase user effort
- **Market-manipulation**: Reducing bargaining power, opaque deactivations
- **Lock-in**: High switching costs prevent users from leaving

---

## Solutions (Per Doctorow)

1. **End-to-end principle**: Platforms should transmit data in response to user requests, not algorithm-driven decisions
2. **Right of exit**: Users can leave platforms without losing access to data (requires interoperability)

---

## Impact

- **Cognitive harm**: Platforms overproduce ads, lose original function, causing loss in ability to process information
- **Labor market effects**: Gig platforms steadily degrade work quality for contractors
- **User migration**: Fear of missing out keeps users on decaying platforms, but many migrate between multiple social media
